/* This is a recreation of Tunnel which was a favorite pass time of mine 
in math class on a Ti-83+ calculator.  The goal is to maneuver the ship 
left and right and avoid the sides of the tunnel.  In this version, the 
ship is controlled by the potentiometer.  The switches are there to 
start the game.  Sound assets from Space Invaders are thrown in the mark 
the start and end of the game.  And also the LEDs are warning signals.


Special shout out to the two professors Dr. Jonathan Valvano and 
Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi for the fantastic course!  And also to Jason King 
who was so incredibly helpful on the forum and worked with a few of the 
quirks in my code.
